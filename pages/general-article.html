                <h3>Word Wide Web General</h3>
                <p>Technologies like HTML, the URL system, transfer protocols like HTTP made the word wide web successful at CERN and later at the whole internet.</p>
                <p>The resources of a website like the html pages and the images are adressed with uniform resource locators (URLs).</p>
                <p>
                    The full syntax of every url consists of this parts:
                    <br>&lt;transfer protocol like "https"&gt; :// &lt;subdomain like "www"&gt; . &lt;domain like "google"&gt; . &lt;top level domain&gt; / &lt;path to an page or asset (images)&gt; ? &lt;paramters seperated by an &&gt; # &lt;fragment (section of a page) like general&gt;

                <h3>Web Server</h3>
                <p>A web server is a computer with special software connected to the internet.</p>
                <p>
                    The web server receives web requests commonly send via the http protocol.
                    The request is sent by an web client, which can be a web browser or a web crawler(automatic bot, that for example searches the internet for websites for a search engine).
                    The web server then sends a response, that is either an error or the user requested content or page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Content files like images, videos and audios can be stored directly on the file system of the web server
                    or can be taken from specialised content-delivery-systems that are basically an array of servers that just hold content files.
                    The content files can also be stored on external cloud storage systems.

                <h3>Web Client</h3>
                <p>
                    A web client is a software that can send and receive web requests like https requests, http error codes and can typically render them.
                    Common web clients are web browsers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A web client is typically a web browser that sends http requests to a web server.
                    When the request is valid and the web client has the required permissions the web server sends a response with the requested files to the web client.
                    If the requested content is a page, the client reads all associated files like html pages, stylesheets and etc. and renders them to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, yes, but a web client can also be download manager that sends http requests to download a file but does not render them or extensions
                    that enhance the browser to support special services from the site like Adobe Flash Player.

                    The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.
                    Metadata is data about the HTML document.
                    Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code> must be present on every html document and defines which document type the browser has to expect.
                    <br>For example: modern <strong>HTML 5</strong> is defined with a simple <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> tag.
                    <br>The older version <strong>HTML 4</strong> is defined following: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>This is a emphasized text</em> that is is marked with the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> html tag.
                    It is probably displayed as a cursive or bold text in your browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <mark>This is a marked text</mark> that is is marked with the <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> html tag.
                    It is displayed as a text with a colored background color like yellow in your browser.
